## üõ† SQL Queries & Analysis

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration & Cleaning**  

```sql
-- View all records
SELECT * FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- Count total transactions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- Count unique customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- List all unique product categories
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- Identify missing/null values in the dataset
SELECT * FROM `retail sales analysis`
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantiy IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

-- Remove records with missing values
DELETE FROM `retail sales analysis`
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantiy IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Performance Analysis**

```sql

-- Total revenue per month
SELECT MONTH(sale_date) AS month, SUM(total_sale) AS Revenue 
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY month;

-- Daily & hourly sales trends (Peak sales times)
SELECT DAY(sale_date) AS daily, HOUR(sale_date) AS hourly, SUM(total_sale) AS Revenue 
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY daily, hourly
ORDER BY daily, hourly;

-- Average order value per customer
SELECT AVG(total_sale) AS average_order_value 
FROM `retail sales analysis`;

```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Insights**

```sql

-- Gender distribution of customers
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY gender;

-- Age group that makes the most purchases
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN '18-25'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26-35'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
        ELSE '50+'
    END AS age_group, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_purchases
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY total_purchases DESC;

```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Product & Category Insights**

```sql

-- Product category generating the most revenue
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS revenue 
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

-- Most frequently purchased category
SELECT category, SUM(quantiy) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;

-- Category with the highest average order value
SELECT category, AVG(total_sale) AS avg_order_value
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_order_value DESC;

```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Insights**

```sql

-- Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) per month
SELECT MONTH(sale_Date) AS month, SUM(cogs) AS total_cost 
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month, total_cost;

-- Profit margin for each product category
SELECT category, 
       SUM(total_sale - cogs) AS total_profit, 
       (SUM(total_sale - cogs) * 100.0 / SUM(total_sale)) AS profit_margin
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

-- Most profitable day of the week
SELECT (sale_date) AS weekday, 
       SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY weekday
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Behavior Analysis**

```sql

-- Number of customers making repeat purchases
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING purchase_count > 1
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC;

-- Average quantity of items purchased per transaction
SELECT AVG(quantiy) AS avg_items_per_transaction
FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- Total transactions by gender in each category
SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_transactions
FROM `retail sales analysis`
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;

```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Shift Analysis**

-- Sales by shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM `retail sales analysis`
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift;
