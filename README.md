### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration & Cleaning**  

```sql
-- View all records
SELECT * FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- Count total transactions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- Count unique customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- List all unique product categories
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM `retail sales analysis`;

-- Identify missing/null values in the dataset
SELECT * FROM `retail sales analysis`
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantiy IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

-- Remove records with missing values
DELETE FROM `retail sales analysis`
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantiy IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
